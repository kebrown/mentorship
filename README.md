## Guidelines for mentors
Women Who Code DC provides the platform for students to find mentors. We will not actively facilitate student-mentor relationships. That said, all interactions between members must abide by our code of conduct https://www.womenwhocode.com/codeofconduct.

Since the mentors are providing a free service, it is the responsibility of the mentee to reach out and schedule a meeting. We recommend that you meet 2-3 times a month for about an hour. It is best to have a concrete goal and a designated end date for the mentorship relationship.

## Aggregating Resources
In order to assist mentors, we ask for your help assembling learning resources and exercises for topics listed below (feel free to add more topics as well). The exercises and resources should be separated into beginner, intermediate, and advanced categories.
