## Guidelines for mentors
Women Who Code DC provides the platform for students to find mentors. We will not actively facilitate student-mentor relationships. That said, all interactions between members must abide by our code of conduct https://www.womenwhocode.com/codeofconduct.

Since the mentors are providing a free service, it is the responsibility of the mentee to reach out and schedule a meeting. We recommend that you meet 2-3 times a month for about an hour. It is best to have a concrete goal and a designated end date for the mentorship relationship.

## Guidelines for mentees
Our mentors are volunteers. Be respectful of their time; do not be late to sessions; do not miss sessions; if you need to skip a session inform your mentor ASAP. Remember, all interactions between members must abide by our code of conduct https://www.womenwhocode.com/codeofconduct.

Before seeking a mentor, figure out what concrete things you want to get out of a student/mentor relationship. Be clear with your mentor about your goals, and expect the mentorship to end once those goals have been reached.

## Aggregating Resources
In order to assist mentors, we ask for your help assembling learning resources and exercises for topics listed below (feel free to add more topics as well). The exercises and resources should be separated into beginner, intermediate, and advanced categories.
